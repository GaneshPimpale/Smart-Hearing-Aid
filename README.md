# Smart-Hearing-Aid
A smart hearing aid that not only provides amplification and hearing aid functionality at a more accessible price point, but also allows users to playback recorded audio that is temporarily stored as set by the user.

# How It Works
* Heading Aid
    * [Description coming soon...]
* Recording
    * When the user presses a button on the smart hearing aid, the Arduino will begin to read in analog input from the microphone. This data is read in through the COM3 port (standard speed of 9600) by PuTTY and saved to Output.txt
